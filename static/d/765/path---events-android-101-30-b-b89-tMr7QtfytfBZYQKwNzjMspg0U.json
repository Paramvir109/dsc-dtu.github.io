This is the first in a series of workshops to learn building Android applications from scratch.</p>\n<h3>Time: 1:15 PM IST</h3>\n<h2>Topics Covered</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction to Android</li>\n<li>Working with Android Studio</li>\n<li>What are SDKs? How do we use them?</li>\n<li>Building our first simple app</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>As Android Studio is a heavy software, it will require time to install. To help you do this, we recommend following <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/install\">these instructions</a> or contacting us at the SOSC Room in the 4th floor at Sahaydri College of Engineering &#x26; Management during the first break. We will help you install Android Studio on your system before during the week right up to before the event. </p>\n<h2>This is a BYOC event</h2>\n<p>We'll be giving you hands-on experience on how to work with Android. So the event is Bring Your Own Computer workshop, your Laptops will be of great help here. Also, please note that running Android Studio with any system <strong>below 4GB RAM</strong> will be a tedious process. We reccommend having a laptop with minimum 4GB RAM. </p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A visit to the SOSC Room to install Android Studio should you need help with it</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Trainers and Mentors</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/akashdeepb\">Akashdeep Bhagat</a>, Android Lead - DSC</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ShreyasBaliga\">Shreyas Baliga</a>, Flutter Lead - DSC</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/melwinlobo18\">Melwin Lobo</a>, GCP Lead - DSC</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/coderhawk999\">Afroz</a>, PWA Lead - DSC</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/akshayrb22\">Akshay Ram Bhat</a>, Lead - DSC</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/events/android-101","name":"Android 101","date":"30-Mar-2019","location":"LH 201","link":"http://bit.ly/2Yj27lX","feedback_link":"http://bit.ly/2FxYy3W","cover":{"publicURL":"/static/cover-b41f35946b26277075ecb1c20ab5f945.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='400' height='225'%3e%3cpath d='M0 113v112h30l29-1 5-6a327 327 0 0 0 24-27l6-7a375 375 0 0 0 29-33l7-7a594 594 0 0 1 24-29l3-3-3-3a1009 1009 0 0 1-54-62l-6-7A673 673 0 0 0 65 7l-6-7H0v113m91-44c-7 3-9 9-6 17 1 1 0 2-1 3-3 2-2 3 2 3 3-1 5 0 8 1 20 13 41-3 24-18-7-5-21-9-27-6M46 82c0 3 0 4-4 5s-11 7-10 9v2l-3 4-1 4 1-4c0-5-1-7-4-7-4 0-4 1-8 12-4 10-4 12 1 13 3 0 3 0 5-4 3-8 4-11 5-10l-3 9c-5 11-5 15 0 16l-1 6c-2 6-1 8 3 9 3 0 4-1 6-6 1-4 2-4 4-4 3 0 3 0 1 6-2 5-2 5-1 8 4 4 8 1 10-7 1-2 1-3 5-3l4 1 3-8c4-8 5-9 3-2v7c3 2 6 1 8-3a2525 2525 0 0 1 6-18c0-5-6-6-8-1l-2 1 1-3c1-1 0-2-1-3-2-1-2-1 0-1 3 1 3 1 3-4l-2-10c-2-3-2-4 0-5s1-2-2-1c-1 1-2 1-5-1l-8-3c-3 0-4 0-4-2l-1-5-1 3' fill='%23d3d3d3' fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/static/b41f35946b26277075ecb1c20ab5f945/5b12f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b41f35946b26277075ecb1c20ab5f945/80b6c/cover.jpg 250w,\n/static/b41f35946b26277075ecb1c20ab5f945/9b3c4/cover.jpg 500w,\n/static/b41f35946b26277075ecb1c20ab5f945/5b12f/cover.jpg 1000w,\n/static/b41f35946b26277075ecb1c20ab5f945/7a298/cover.jpg 1500w,\n/static/b41f35946b26277075ecb1c20ab5f945/36e49/cover.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
